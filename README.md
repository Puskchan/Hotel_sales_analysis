# Hospitality Dashboard

In this end-to-end data analytics project, we focus on AtliQ Grands' hospitality data. The company is facing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to competition and poor management decisions. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics for the company, allowing business to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions to enhance operations, improve guest satisfaction, and optimize revenue.
